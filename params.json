The first player sets the word and then the second player actually guesses. And the actual communication part is to indicate loss or win by LEDS! There is also a RESET function if you lose or wish to choose another word. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/PaulineOC/Processing-ITP-7-Hangman/blob/master/Win.png?raw=true\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/PaulineOC/Processing-ITP-7-Hangman/blob/master/arduinowin.jpeg?raw=true\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/PaulineOC/Processing-ITP-7-Hangman/blob/master/Loss.png?raw=true\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/PaulineOC/Processing-ITP-7-Hangman/blob/master/lostarduino.jpeg?raw=true\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer: capital letters aren’t recognized and you can’t use backspace. Furthermore, when guessing a letter, “spaces” are counted as incorrect and somehow if you don’t enter anything (i.e. press “ENTER” without an actual input), it may break my game.\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to original blog:\r\nhttps://itp.nyu.edu/classes/icm-dano-spring2014/hangman/",
