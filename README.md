# Processing-ITP-7-Hangman

As a final revisit to our ICM class, I’ve created another game for the Telecommunications homework unlike the one-that-tried to-be-ambitious-with-rotation-but-failed. This game is a two-player Hangman (under 10 letters or less). The first player sets the word and then the second player actually guesses. And the actual communication part is to indicate loss or win by LEDS! There is also a RESET function if you lose or wish to choose another word. 

**Disclaimer: capital letters aren’t recognized and you can’t use backspace. Furthermore, when guessing a letter, “spaces” are counted as incorrect and somehow if you don’t enter anything (i.e. press “ENTER” without an actual input), it may break my game.
